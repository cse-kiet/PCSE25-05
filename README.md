## 🚀 Project Overview

This project aims to develop a real-time hand gesture recognition system tailored for Indian Sign Language (ISL). Leveraging the power of deep learning and the YOLOv9 object detection framework, our model detects and classifies 26 different gestures corresponding to A–Z alphabets of ISL.

## ⚙️ Steps to Execute the Project

1. Clone this repository and navigate to the project root directory.
2. Go to the `Detection` folder.
3. Open and run the `detection.ipynb` notebook.
4. Clone the [YOLOv9 repository](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov9) (if not already cloned).
5. Update the model weights as needed in the notebook:
   - You can switch between YOLOv9-C and YOLOv9-E, or use custom-trained weights.
6. Run the detection cells to begin live gesture recognition.
